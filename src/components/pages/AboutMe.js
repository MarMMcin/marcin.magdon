        &emsp; My name is Marcin, I'm front-end developer from Rzeszów.
        <br></br> I've always liked to create pages. I made the first page on
        the IT classes in junior high school. After school, I started studying
        spatial planning because of my passions and interests, but unfortunately
        it wasn't a good choice.<br></br>&emsp; After a few years break, I
        returned to the front-end, and created several new positions in
        completely different technologists
